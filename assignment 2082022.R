#comment- Here class and typeof function is giving the same output as numeric as we can see...
# but there is a fundamental difference in the two function class is the container of an object,an attribute that makes the object behave externally with functions that take this particular "type of" object as argument
#The function class prints the vector of names of classes an object inherits from.Say, if an element comes from matrix of numeric values then class will be matrix and type of will be numeric.
